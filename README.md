# To generate React bundle

# 1. Clone this repo to your computer with:
`git clone https://github.com/jeffkeelingbu/team1.git`

# 2. Use the terminal to navigate to the cloned repo and in the directory with `package.json` and run:
`npm install`

# 3. Then run 
`npm run dev-build`

4. You'll know everything worked if you open up the `index.html` file in your browser and it should say "Rendered Main" in green.
